# Weather-Trend-Dataset-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
To analyse and visualize daily weather patterns across major Indian cities using temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind data. This dataset supports trend analysis and interactive dashboard creation in Tableau or Excel to aid climate monitoring and decision-making.

## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/SnehaKDuglet/Weather-Trends-Dataset/blob/main/Weather%20Trends%20Dataset.xlsx"> Dataset 

## Questions (KPIs)
-Overall average temperature recorded across all cities.
-Sum of rainfall in all cities during the 7-day period.
-Highest wind speed measured across all data points.
-Coldest temperature observed and the city/date it occurred.
-Maximum 'feels like' temperature during the week.
-Most commonly occurring weather condition (e.g., Rainy, Sunny).
-Mean atmospheric humidity across the dataset.
-Average visibility (in km) — indicates air clarity or haze levels.
-Highest UV Index observed — relevant for health safety measures.
-Date with the highest single-day rainfall.

## Process
-Simulated weather data for 5 Indian cities over 7 days, including temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, and more.
-Structured and formatted the dataset in Excel for consistency and readability.
-Imported into Tableau Public to create trend lines, bar charts, calendar heatmaps, and KPI cards.
-Combined key insights into a clean, interactive dashboard for easy comparison and analysis.
